2016-01-10 version 0.8:

  This release includes a number of fixes from Takashi Kato <ktakashi@ymail.com>
  that address issues with the portability of this library to other Scheme
  platforms, such as Vicare Scheme (http://marcomaggi.github.io/vicare.html),
  along with general correctness. In particular:

  * Top-level `option' declarations are now supported (and ignored).
  * Portability issues fixed for code generated by Scheme implementations with a
  `generate-temporaries' implementation that does not produce portably
  serializable identifiers.
  * Runtime portability issues fixed for Scheme implementations on which an R6RS
  record type name does not expand to a reference to its RTD.
  * Block comments in Protocol Buffer definitions are now supported.
  * Fix exports missing from the private runtime library.
  * Fix import collisions between `(rnrs base)' and `(srfi :13)'.
  * Fix broken type predicates for the `uint32' and `uint64' field types.

2014-03-31 version 0.7:

  * Fix serious deserialization issues related to embedded message fields.
  * Remove export of non-existent symbol.

2013-02-08 version 0.6:

  * Fix serious deserialization issues related to field order.
  * Add the `protoc-scm' compiler front-end under `contrib/guile'.

2013-01-05 version 0.5:

  * `protobuf:generate-libraries' in `(protobuf compile)' now accepts an 
  optional argument giving a base directory for resolving import directives.
  * Make type resolution and dependency generation more sophisticated in order 
  to support multiple levels of import directives with different relative paths
  and per-.proto visibility of imported types.
  * Write message fields in order for politeness.
  * Fix serious issues related to serializing message fields of an enumerated
  or message type.

2012-12-08 version 0.4:

  * Make library generation code safe for multi-definition packages by 
  generating a separate library for each package-level definition.
  * New function in `(protobuf protobuf)' `protobuf:version'.

2012-06-12 version 0.3:

  * Add parser support for comments in .proto files.

2011-06-11 version 0.2:

  * Add support for default values for optional fields.
  * Fix assorted issues related to type-checking of enum fields.

2011-05-08 version 0.1:

  * First public release.
